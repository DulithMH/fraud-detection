# fraud-detection
This model is an Ensemble-based Predictive Classifier specifically engineered to detect fraudulent activity in highly imbalanced financial datasets.  By leveraging a Random Forest architecture and optimizing it through automated hyperparameter tuning, the model moves beyond simple pattern matching to identify complex, nonlinear patterns
